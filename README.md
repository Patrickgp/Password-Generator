# Password Generator Starter Code

https://patrickgp.github.io/Password-Generator/

The premise of this assignment was to randomly generate a password that meets a certain criteria set by the user. In this product the user can click the "Generate Password" button and will be led through a series of window prompts that will confirm or deny if uppercased, lowercased, special or numerical characters will appear in the users generated password. When prompted for the length of the password the user will have the option to set a length anywhere between 8 - 128 characters. The input is validated and when all the prompts are answered a password is generated and written to the page.
